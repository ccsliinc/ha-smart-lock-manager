# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

Smart Lock Manager takes security seriously. As a component that manages physical lock access codes, we implement comprehensive security measures to protect your smart home and sensitive data.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 2025.1.x| ✅ Yes            | Current stable release |
| 1.0.x   | ⚠️ Limited support | Legacy version - upgrade recommended |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             | End of life |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT report security vulnerabilities in public issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### 📧 Private Reporting Methods

1. **Email**: Send details to `jsugamele@gmail.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ccsliinc/ha-smart-lock-manager/security/advisories/new)

### 📝 What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Component affected**: Which part of Smart Lock Manager
- **Vulnerability type**: Classification (injection, authentication, etc.)
- **Impact assessment**: Potential consequences
- **Reproduction steps**: How to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of concept**: Example code or demonstration (if safe to share)
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for resolution
- **Disclosure timeline**: Your preferred timeline for public disclosure

### 🎯 Security Focus Areas

We prioritize vulnerabilities in these areas:

- **High Priority**:
  - PIN code exposure or logging
  - Authentication bypass
  - Code injection attacks
  - Unauthorized lock control
  - Data exposure in logs or storage

- **Medium Priority**:
  - Service validation bypass
  - Frontend security issues
  - API authentication weaknesses
  - Information disclosure

- **Lower Priority**:
  - UI-only vulnerabilities
  - Documentation issues
  - Non-security functionality bugs

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization

- **PIN Code Validation**: Strict numeric validation (4-8 digits)
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization in frontend components
- **Command Injection Prevention**: No shell command execution with user input

### 🔒 Data Protection

- **PIN Code Masking**: PIN codes never appear in logs as plaintext
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage using Home Assistant's secure storage API
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory when not needed
- **Debug Mode Safety**: Debug logging excludes sensitive information

### 🚨 Access Control

- **Home Assistant Authentication**: Leverages HA's built-in authentication
- **Service Validation**: All service calls validated for proper entity access
- **Z-Wave Security**: Respects Z-Wave JS security protocols
- **API Endpoint Protection**: Custom panel routes require authentication

### 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

- **Security Event Logging**: Logs security-relevant events
- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: Monitors and logs failed operations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all lock operations
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose internals

## 🔧 Security Testing

### 🧪 Automated Security Scanning

We use multiple security tools in our CI/CD pipeline:

- **Bandit**: Python security vulnerability scanner
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- **Vulture**: Dead code detection (security hygiene)
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks on every commit

### ✅ Current Security Status

As of v2025.1.0:
- **Security Scan Status**: ✅ Passing (1 low-severity finding)
- **Vulnerability Count**: 0 known vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies scanned and secure
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive security test suite

### 🎯 Security Test Coverage

Our test suite includes:

- **Input Validation Tests**: PIN codes, slot numbers, date formats
- **Injection Attack Tests**: SQL, XSS, command injection attempts
- **Authentication Tests**: Service call authorization
- **Data Exposure Tests**: Log content verification
- **Error Handling Tests**: Secure error message validation

## 🛠️ Security Configuration

### 🔒 Recommended Security Settings

```yaml
# Home Assistant configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    # Enable security monitoring (excludes sensitive data)
    custom_components.smart_lock_manager: info
    # Avoid debug level in production to prevent data exposure
    # custom_components.smart_lock_manager: debug  # Only for troubleshooting

# Smart Lock Manager configuration
smart_lock_manager:
  # Security-focused settings
  auto_disable_expired: true    # Automatically disable expired codes
  sync_on_lock_events: true     # Keep locks synchronized
  debug_logging: false          # Never enable in production
```

### 🚨 Security Best Practices

1. **PIN Code Management**:
   - Use unique, non-sequential PIN codes
   - Regularly rotate temporary codes
   - Set expiration dates for all codes
   - Monitor usage statistics for anomalies

2. **System Security**:
   - Keep Home Assistant updated
   - Use strong authentication for Home Assistant
   - Enable 2FA where possible
   - Regularly review access logs

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use encrypted Z-Wave communication
   - Secure your Home Assistant network
   - Monitor for unusual Z-Wave activity
   - Keep Z-Wave JS updated
